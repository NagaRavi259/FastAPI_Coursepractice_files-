## why go language
-  at that time of go we have most popular languages 
    - C/C++
        - Where C/C++ fast but to code its comples and also its compile time is very slow. As the C/C++ has the lot of legacy code still need to compile today
        - when they develop C/C++ at that time the computer memory is very less when compared to today so they decided to optimize by using the minimum memory to use at the time of compiling because of that it takes time to compile
    - java
        - Java is very quick but while coading it is very complex when we going with large scale and features when we going through additional features
    - python
        - python is slow because of it is interpreted language but to code it is easiest language
        - when we going large applicatins it takes lot of time to complete large scale of operations
    - when they time of thsese three languages created they decided to use single thread so concurrency patterns pached in at best so working in large scale application is little bit challanging at the time of developping Go(Golang)

## Features of Go(Golang)
- Strong and statically typed
    - so it inherets same features from java and C/C++
    - Stong means 
        - if created a variable to store the integer value of 5 or any it can store only the integer value it cant be changes over time
    - Static typing means
        - all of the variables have to be defined at compile time 
- Execellent comunity
    - Go language has a execellent comunity to help and understand for a new lerners and update accourding to the technology
- ## Key Features
    - Simpicity
    - Fast compile times
    - Garbage collected 
        - it has a builtin grbage collect management built into the go language. also we can manage manually if we wanted
    - Built-in cocurrency
    - compile to standalone binaries
